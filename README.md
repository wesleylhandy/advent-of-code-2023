# Advent Of Code

https://adventofcode.com/2023

Our book club at work is currently working through Kyle Simpson's [You Don't Know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS), so I figured it would be fun rolling this year using vanilla JS in a NodeJS 20 cone.

## Running

Each completed day is exposed by a very simple CLI taking a single argument, the day to be run. For example:

```sh
npm run start 1 # 1 being for December 1
```
